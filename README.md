# TS-Benchmark

#### Description

This project is the source code of TS-Benchmark.

#### Start

The general steps to complete the test are:

1. Data generation 
``cd data_generation``

2. Train DCGAN model
``python DCGAN.py``
Run the ``encoder_dc.py`` file to train the encoder, ``python encoder_dc.py``
Finally execute the test ``python test_dc.py``

2. Data Import 
Since each database have different build-in tools for data import, we have defined some tools related to data import in the ``tsdb-test/data/load``  directory

3. build project
``cd Tsdb-benchmark/ts-benchmark/``
``sh build.sh``

4. config parametes of database and run the benchmark
``cd Tsdb-benchmark/ts-benchmark/``
``vim run.sh`` (choose database and test mode)
``sh run.sh``

#### Params description

The configuration of TSDBs is shown as follows:

- InfluxDB. We enlarge the default values of some important parameters of the TSM engine for better performance of the system. For example, the parameter wal-fsync- delay is set as "0s", the parameter ``cache-max-memory-size`` is set to 1,048,576,000 bytes, and the parameter cache-snapshot-memory-size is enlarged to “100M” and so on. Maximum memory size is sufficient. The parameter ``max-values-per-tag`` is set as 0 to allow an unlimited number of tag values.
- TimescaleDB. The parameter ``shared-buffers`` is set as 8GB, ``maintenance-work-mem`` is set as 2GB, ``checkpoint-completion-target`` is set as 0.7, ``min_wal`` size is set as 1GB, and max wal size is 2GB. Parameters of PostgreSQL is set based on PgTune.
- Druid. The parameter ``Roll-up`` is set as true, and ``Granu-larity`` is set as hour. For local batch import, the parameter maxRowsPerSegment is set as 10M, maxRowsInMemory is set as 20M, and maxTotalRows is set as 100M. 
- OpenTSDB. The parameter ``tsd-http-request-enable-chunked`` is enabled, ``tsd-http-request-max-chunk`` is set as 32KB, ``tsd-core-auto-create-metrics`` is set as true, and the parameter ``tsd-storage-enable-compaction`` is set to be false to improve the write performance.
